Assignment A6

I created an interactive map to answer the question "According to this dataset, how many seven-elevens are there in the US?" I first searched up all seven-elevens within the "Store_name" column using the str_detect function since each seven-eleven had a unique code after it. After I filtered out all of the other stores, I counted the amount of seven-elevens per state and then I plotted it. I added a small interactive feature where the user can hover their mouse over the state and it will say state name and the number of seven-elevens in that state according to the dataset.
